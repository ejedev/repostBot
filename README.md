# repostBot
A bot for reddit that sorts by new and comments on reposts from the same subreddit.

# Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PRAW 5
- Reddit account

# Set up
You will need to authorize a new application with reddit (this can be done at https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/)

This will provide you with the client_id and secret for lines 5 and 6.

# Disclaimer
This was made to test out PRAW and is most likely considered spam. Most subreddits will ban your account and my test account was shadowbanned site-wide after 24 hours. Update: after contacting the admins the account was unbanned as it was an error.

Do not use this on an account you care about.

The code is a bit sloppy and does not use best practices so don't be suprised if something breaks.
